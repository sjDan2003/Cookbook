{"_Name": "Sauteed Broccolini and Garlic", "_Instructions": "In a large pot, bring 8 cups of water and the salt to a boil. Remove and discard the bottom third of the broccolini stems. If some stems are very thick, cut them in half lengthwise. When the water comes to a full boil, add the broccolini, return to a boil, and cook over high heat for 2 minutes, until the stalks are crisp tender. Drain and immediately immerse the broccolini in a large bowl filled with ice water to stop the cooking. Drain in a colander and set aside. Heat the oil in a saute pan. Add the garlic and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the broccolini and stir until heated through.", "_IngredientList": {"ingredient3": "garlic cloves, minced", "quantity2": "3", "quantity0": "2", "ingredient0": "kosher salt", "ingredient2": "good olive oil", "units2": "tablespoons", "ingredient1": "broccolini (1 1/2 pounds)", "quantity1": "4", "units1": "bunches", "units3": "", "quantity3": "6", "units0": "tablespoons"}}
